## Known Issues

###Â File Upload Limit

When uploading many times the ***same*** file, it seems that infomaniaks servers flags you as suspicous traffic and you won't be able to upload for a while. It seems to be linked to your IP address, no extensive testing has been done. Use the debug mode to see the error message. :warning:
